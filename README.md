# ToDoList - A Simple SwiftUI To-Do List App

## Introduction

Welcome to my first SwiftUI project, **ToDoList**! This is a basic to-do list application that allows you to keep track of your tasks and their due dates. As I delve into SwiftUI, I wanted to create a simple yet functional app to demonstrate my understanding of the framework.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots showcasing different aspects of the ToDoList app:

1. **Task List View:**

   In the initial screen, you can see a list of tasks. The top-left corner features an "Edit" button for deletion and rearrangement of tasks. The top-right corner has a "+" button that takes you to another screen to add a new task.

2. **Add Task View:**

   (https://github.com/ozguncanbey/ToDoList/assets/138692325/8ac84086-32b8-46a5-bfd3-0ca4556faffe)
   In the "Add Task" screen, you can input the details of a new task. There's a text field to enter the task description and a date picker to select the due date. After filling in the details, you can save the task using the "Save" button.

4. **Editing Mode:**

   When you tap the "Edit" button on the main screen, you can delete or rearrange tasks. The editing mode provides checkboxes next to each task for selection.

5. **Task Deletion:**
   (https://github.com/ozguncanbey/ToDoList/assets/138692325/2ab1c3cb-328f-4fd6-a8b2-1d700070bf93)
   In editing mode, you can swipe left on a task to reveal the delete button. Tapping the delete button removes the task from the list.


## How to Use

1. Open the app to view the list of tasks.
2. Tap the "Edit" button to enter editing mode, enabling task deletion and reordering.
3. Use the "+" button to navigate to the "Add Task" screen.
4. Enter the task description and select a due date using the date picker.
5. Tap the "Save" button to return to the main screen with the updated task list.

## Conclusion

The **ToDoList** app demonstrates the fundamental concepts of SwiftUI, providing a simple and intuitive way to manage your tasks. As my first SwiftUI project, I hope this app reflects my learning journey and the potential for more complex projects in the future.
